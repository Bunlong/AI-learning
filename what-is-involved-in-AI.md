# What’s Involved in AI

AI is a vast area of study. This field of study helps in finding solutions to real world problems.

Let us now see the different fields of study within AI:

### Machine Learning

It is one of the most popular fields of AI. The basic concept of this filed is to make the machine learning from data as the human beings can learn from his/her experience. It contains learning models on the basis of which the predictions can be made on unknown data.

### Logic

It is another important field of study in which mathematical logic is used to execute the computer programs. It contains rules and facts to perform pattern matching, semantic analysis, etc.

### Searching

This field of study is basically used in games like chess, tic-tac-toe. Search algorithms give the optimal solution after searching the whole search space.

### Artificial neural networks

This is a network of efficient computing systems the central theme of which is borrowed from the analogy of biological neural networks. ANN can be used in robotics, speech recognition, speech processing, etc.

### Genetic Algorithm

Genetic algorithms help in solving problems with the assistance of more than one program. The result would be based on selecting the fittest.

### Knowledge Representation

It is the field of study with the help of which we can represent the facts in a way the machine that is understandable to the machine. The more efficiently knowledge is represented; the more system would be intelligent.

## Application of AI

The different fields supported by AI:

### Gaming

AI plays crucial role in strategic games such as chess, poker, tic-tac-toe, etc., where machine can think of large number of possible positions based on heuristic knowledge.

### Natural Language Processing

It is possible to interact with the computer that understands natural language spoken by humans.

### Expert Systems

There are some applications which integrate machine, software, and special information to impart reasoning and advising. They provide explanation and advice to the users.

### Vision Systems

These systems understand, interpret, and comprehend visual input on the computer. For example:

  * A spying aeroplane takes photographs, which are used to figure out spatial information or map of the areas.
  * Doctors use clinical expert system to diagnose the patient.
  * Police use computer software that can recognize the face of criminal with the stored portrait made by forensic artist.

### Speech Recognition

Some intelligent systems are capable of hearing and comprehending the language in terms of sentences and their meanings while a human talks to it. It can handle different accents, slang words, noise in the background, change in human’s noise due to cold, etc.

### Handwriting Recognition

The handwriting recognition software reads the text written on paper by a pen or on screen by a stylus. It can recognize the shapes of the letters and convert it into editable text.

### Intelligent Robots

Robots are able to perform the tasks given by a human. They have sensors to detect physical data from the real world such as light, heat, temperature, movement, sound, bump, and pressure. They have efficient processors, multiple sensors and huge memory, to exhibit intelligence. In addition, they are capable of learning from their mistakes and they can adapt to the new environment.
