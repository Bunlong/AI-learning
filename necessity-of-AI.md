# Necessity of AI

As we know that AI pursues creating the machines as intelligent as human beings.

## AI can learn through data

In our daily life, we deal with huge amount of data and human brain cannot keep track of so much data. That is why we need to automate the things. For doing automation, we need to study AI because it can learn from data and can do the repetitive tasks with accuracy and without tiredness.

## AI can teach itself

It is very necessary that a system should teach itself because the data itself keeps changing and the knowledge which is derived from such data must be updated constantly. We can use AI to fulfill this purpose because an AI enabled system can teach itself.

## AI can respond in real time

AI with the help of neural networks can analyze the data more deeply. Due to this capability, AI can think and respond to the situations which are based on the conditions in real time.

## AI achieves accuracy

With the help of deep neural networks, AI can achieve tremendous accuracy. AI helps in the field of medicine to diagnose diseases such as cancer from the MRIs of patients.

## AI can organize data to get most out of it

The data is an intellectual property for the systems which are using self-learning algorithms. We need AI to index and organize the data in a way that it always gives the best results.

## Understanding Intelligence

With AI, smart systems can be built. We need to understand the concept of intelligence so that our brain can construct another intelligence system like itself.
