# Artificial Intelligence

## What is AI?

AI is a way of studying how human brain thinks, and how humans learn, decide, and work while trying to solve a problem, and then using the outcomes of this study as a basis of developing intelligent software and systems.

## Goals of AI

* **To Create Expert Systems** - The systems which exhibit intelligent behavior, learn, demonstrate, explain, and advice its users.
* **To Implement Human Intelligence in Machines** - Creating systems that understand, think, learn, and behave like humans.

## What Contributes to AI?

Artificial intelligence is a science and technology based on disciplines such as Computer Science, Psychology, Neuron Science, Biology, Mathematics, Sociology, Philosophy.

## Programming Without AI and With AI

| Programming Without AI | Programming With AI |
| :--------------------- | :------------------ |
| A computer program without AI can answer the specific questions it is meant to solve. | A computer program with AI can answer the generic questions it is meant to solve. |
| Modification in the program leads to change in its structure. | AI programs can absorb new modifications by putting highly independent pieces of information together. Hence you can modify even a minute piece of information of program without affecting its structure. |
| Modification is not quick and easy. It may lead to affecting the program adversely. | Quick and Easy program modification. |
